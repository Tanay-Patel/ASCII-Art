# ASCII Image Generator

## What is this?

In this project, I used Python in order to convert an image into text that can be copied and pasted anywhere!

People have made some really impressive ASCII art and I would love to be able to do the same. Unfortunately I am really bad at creating ASCII art and creating large scale ASCII art by keyboard can take a lot of time. However I knew that I could use my programming skills to help me develop my own "artistic process".
